## About Me
My name is Yile. I am a dedicated and ethically driven biomedical scientist with a strong foundation in both wet lab and computational (dry lab) techniques. My research centers on unraveling the molecular underpinnings of atrial myopathy and atrial fibrillation, leveraging cutting-edge single-cell multi-omics and artificial intelligence. I am passionate about integrating advanced analytical tools with experimental biology to bridge the gap between basic and translational research, with the ultimate goal of advancing our understanding and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
