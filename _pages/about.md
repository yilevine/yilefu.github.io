# About Me
My name is Songpeng Zu, coming from Liaoning Province, China. In July
2011, I got my Bachelor's Degree in Biological Sciences in the School
of Life Science at Tsinghua Univeristy. Then started my PhD studies in
Control Science and Engineer supervised by Prof. Shao Li in the
Department of Automation, Tsinghua Univeristy and got my PhD Degree in
Jan 2017. My thesis focused on applying statistical machine learning
in predicting drug-protein interactions.

I had near three-year industrial experience on deep learning.  In
Jan 2017, after my graduetion, I went to the recommendation team in
HULU as a machine learning researcher. In Nov 2018, I joined
the CityBrain Lab under DAMO Academy, Alibaba.

After that, inspired by AlphaFold and also my collegues, I decided to
follow my major interests on developing tools for biological data
analysis. And I believe it's also the right time and right field for
artifical intelligence. In Aug 2019, I became a post-doctoral fellow
in Prof. Jun Liu's lab at Harvard University to develop statistical
methods for single-cell sequencing data analysis. From July 2021 till
now, I am a post-doctoral fellow in Prof. Bing Ren's lab at Univeristy
of California, San Diego, where I study epigenetics and neuroscience
by analyzing large-scale ATAC-seq data on the whole mouse brain.
