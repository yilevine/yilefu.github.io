## Abstract
Online Video Streaming services such as Hulu hosts tens of millions of premium videos, which requires an effective recommendation system to help viewers discover what they enjoy. In this talk, we will introduce Hulu's recent technical progresses in recommender systems and deep-dive into the topic of generating recommendation reason from knowledge graph. We have two user scenarios: the store-shelf and autoplay. The first requires a list of videos to maximize the chance that a viewer would pick one of them to watch. The second requires a sequence of video recommendations such that the viewer would continuously watch within the current session.
